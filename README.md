# Monokai-Grey
A truely gray version of Monokai. The original Monokai has an ever-so-slight greenish tinge to it; this makes it all grey.

## What's Different?
The difference is quite small; to grey the tints, I calculated the average of the 3 RGB colours. Example:
  * Theme default for regular text is `rgb(248,248,240)`, but I did some ez math `(248+248+240)/3` and got `245`.

If you see anything that I missed, let me know or fork it! :)

## How to Install
Installing the theme is very simple. Go to `Preferences > Browse Packages...` in Sublime Text, and make a new folder there. Call it something like "Monokai Grey" or if you're planning on getting more custom themes, "Custom Themes". Place the `Monokai-Grey.tmTheme` file from here and place it in there. You should be good to go!

Thanks to [TmTheme Editor](https://github.com/aziz/tmTheme-Editor) for allowing me to make this theme so easily. Also, thanks to them for having the dummy code!
