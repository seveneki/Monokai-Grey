# Monokai-Grey
A truely gray version of Monokai. The original Monokai has an ever-so-slight greenish tinge to it; this makes it all grey.

## What's Different?
The difference is quite small; to grey the tints, I calculated the average of the 3 RGB colours.
* Example
  * Theme default for regular text is `rgb(248,248,240)`, but I did some ez math `(248+248+240)/3` and got `245`.
